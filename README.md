FINAL PROJECT FOR THE COURSE SHECODES PLUS

Build a weather app using html, css and Javascript. It also includes weather and geolocation apis.

When we type any city in the input element, it shows us the name, temperature, local time and other weather information.

With the geolocation api we can access the current location weather data as well.

I also added media queries so this project fits the different screen sizes and it is responsive.
